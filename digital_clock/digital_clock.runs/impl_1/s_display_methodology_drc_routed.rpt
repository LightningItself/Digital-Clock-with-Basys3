LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell m/m1/b[3]_i_3__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) m/m1/b_reg[0]/CLR, m/m1/b_reg[1]/CLR, m/m1/b_reg[2]/CLR, m/m1/b_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s/s1/b[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s/s1/b_reg[0]/CLR, s/s1/b_reg[1]/CLR, s/s1/b_reg[2]/CLR, s/s1/b_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
